## Scope of the Project

1. Process a dataset of movies and generate similarity-based recommendations.

2. Support fuzzy search and LLM-enhanced movie query expansion.

3. Work fully offline using local computation and a local LLM.

4. Provide a clean Python implementation suitable for academic or personal projects.

## Target Users

1. Students learning AI, ML, or recommendation systems.

2. Developers experimenting with offline LLM-powered applications.

3. Movie enthusiasts seeking personalized movie suggestions.

## High-Level Features

1. Offline movie recommendation engine.

2. Local LLM integration for query expansion.

3. Fuzzy matching for incorrect or partial movie titles.

4. Pre-computed similarity matrix for fast recommendations.

5. Lightweight and privacy-friendly—runs entirely on local machine.
